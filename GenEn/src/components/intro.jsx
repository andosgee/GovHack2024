                    <p className="hero-body"> 
                    New Zealand is currently facing a critical energy crisis. A shortage of gas supply, which is used balance high demand for power when hydro, wind, and solar sources are insufficient, has combined with very low hydro lake levels. This has sent wholesale electricity prices sky rocketing, making New Zealand's prices among the highest in the developed world.Government agencies are prioritizing energy capacity of the grid as their top focus, and analyzing New Zealandâ€™s energy needs growth from the immediate future to 2050, as well as the changing nature of energy sources and associated consumption.
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero-body">With climate change impacting weather patterns, New Zealand's reliance on hydro generation could lead to continued supply uncertainty. To address this, we need to better predict available generation using AI capabilities and incentivize current energy providers to build more capacity. A comprehensive solution using modern AI is essential in this era.By investing in these advanced technologies and diversifying our energy sources, we can create a more stable and sustainable energy future for New Zealand. This approach will ensure that we meet our energy needs while keeping costs manageable and reducing our reliance on non-renewable sources.</p>
